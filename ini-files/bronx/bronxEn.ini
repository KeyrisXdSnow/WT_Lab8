text='The Bronx ranks third in US population density after Manhattan and Brooklyn, and is divided into three districts. The most prestigious is the East Bronx, built up by decent high-rise buildings in which quite wealthy people live. The North Bronx is more like a suburb of a big city. The West Bronx is greener, saturated with large parks and hills. The poorest part can be called the South Bronx, where many low-income emigrants live: to this day there are real slums, and night walks are quite risky.
